# Java Port Scanner (under development)

## Overview

This project is a feature-rich port scanner written in Java.
It can be used to discover open ports, resolve hostnames, analyze HTTP headers, grab SSL certificate information, and perform light web directory brute forcing.

The tool demonstrates practical use of Javaâ€™s networking and I/O libraries, and can generate both console and file-based reports.

## Features

* **Host resolution**: Resolves target hostname and IP.
* **Basic port scan**: Scans common well-known services (FTP, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL, RDP, etc.).
* **Intense scan**: Scans all ports from 1 to 1024.
* **Banner grabbing**: Attempts to read service banners for open ports.
* **HTTP header security checks**: Tests for headers like CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options.
* **Cookie security analysis**: Detects presence of `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags.
* **SSL certificate inspection**: Retrieves subject, issuer, and expiration date from HTTPS servers.
* **Directory brute forcing**: Checks for common web paths based on a supplied wordlist.
* **Report saving**: Optionally writes scan results to a file.

## Requirements

* Java 11 or higher
* Internet connection to reach the target host

## Compilation

Compile the scanner with:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

## Usage

### Basic Scan (common ports)

```bash
java Main
```

## Notes

* Running scans against systems you do not own or lack explicit permission to test may be illegal.
* The tool is intended for **educational and security research purposes only**.
* Some checks (like banner grabbing or brute forcing) may trigger intrusion detection systems.
* Directory brute forcing requires you to supply your own wordlist.
